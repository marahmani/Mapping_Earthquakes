# Mapping_Earthquakes


We used Leaflet.js API to populate a geographical map with GeoJSON earthquake data. Each earthquake is visually represented by a circle and color, where a higher magnitude has a larger diameter and is darker in color. In addition, each earthquake is a popup marker that, when clicked, will show the magnitude of the earthquake and the location of the earthquake. One way to tell stories with data is through interactive maps, which is used in this presentation.

This map consists of different layers to represent different data to the audiance, by clicking on each layer we see different data. three different layers are : Earthquakes, Tectanic Plates, Major Earthquake with the ability of displaying with three different visual map as: streets, satellite and dark.
